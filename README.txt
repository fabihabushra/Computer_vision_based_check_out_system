This proposed billing system is based on computer vision for the check-out of retail items
on the cash counter. Traditionally, supermarkets employ traditional barcode scanners to detect
retail products. The disadvantage of this prevailing check-out system is that it
cannot detect a batch of products simultaneously and is hence time-consuming.
In addition, the traditional system also relies on the speed of the cashierâ€™s workflow in handling the
cash counter. In this regard, this proposed system aims to make batch-billing
of retail items faster and easier, providing a more efficient check-out system at the cash counter.
